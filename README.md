# MATH 3094 Project 2 - Wheat Seeds Classification, A Comparison of Models
The Wheat Seeds data set comes from the Institute of Agrophysics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Lubin. It was originally used in a research paper on a gradient clustering algorithm.  
  
The dataset contains a collection of information about 210 wheat seeds. The data comes from images recorded on 13x18 cm X-ray KODAK plates. The attributes are:
  
  - Area  
  - Perimeter  
  - Compactness  
  - Kernel Length  
  - Kernal Width  
  - Asymmetry Coeff  
  - Kernel Groove  

The seeds are classified by type of seed. The types are specified as follows:
  1. Kama
  2. Rosa
  3. Canadian
  
The dataset can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jmcaro/wheat-seedsuci?resource=download) and UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds).
